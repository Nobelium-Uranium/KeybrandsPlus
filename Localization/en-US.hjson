		Content: This world is quite interesting.
		NoHome: It appears that there is nowhere for me to stay.
		LoveSpace: There's plenty of space for my work, I appreciate it.
		FarFromHome: It seems my residence is quite a ways away.
		DislikeCrowded: It's starting to get a little crowded here, wouldn't you agree?
		HateCrowded: There's much too many people around, and I'm sure they dislike the crowding as well.
		LikeBiome: "This area is quite the hostile paradise, but I don't mind it."
		LoveBiome: "The ocean's horizon reminds me of somewhere I've visited a long time ago..."
		DislikeBiome: "It's rather bleak down here, I'd much rather live on the surface."
		HateBiome: "The darkness here is overwhelming, what a terrible place to be."
		LikeNPC: "{NPCName}'s tech is eerily similar to my own, what a strange coincidence. I'm interested in how it works."
		LoveNPC: "Though {NPCName}'s heart is choked with darkness, I know he means well. I respect that lingering light within him."
		DislikeNPC: "{NPCName} may be an ally, but he reeks of darkness. I think I would rather keep my distance from him."
		HateNPC: "I'm sure {NPCName}'s a good kid, but he comes off as extremely arrogant. I'm not a fan."
		LikeNPC_Princess: "{NPCName}'s heart is outstandingly pure, makes logical sense considering her role as a princess."
