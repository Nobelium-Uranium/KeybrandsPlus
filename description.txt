A far-off memory that's like a scattered dream...
I want to line the pieces up... yours, and mine.

Keybrands+ Re:coded is, as the name suggests, a full rewrite of the original Keybrands+ mod that I made a very long time ago.
It aims to add many keybrands with some being stronger or more versatile than others and also to expand the concepts of multi-class weaponry and equipment.
Gather keybrands throughout the game to combat the Heartless threat and become the one true keybrand master!

Currently, this mod adds:
Many, many keybrands, most providing alternate attack modes and attached abilities, plus a rework of the original Keybrand
A new town NPC, the Keybrand Master who sells restorative potions and useful materials
A new currency, Munny, used to purchase various goods
Several crafting materials, used to make and upgrade keybrands, among other things
Several consumables, including a salty yet sweet treat, and a panacea to cure all that ails you
Several accessories, including the Crown Charm which will grant you a second chance, and multiple tiers of enhanced gliding
This mod also introduces a new resource used by keybrands, MP, which does not regenerate naturally but can be restored through several methods and will recharge when depleted

Planned features:
Many more keybrands! It wouldn't be Keybrands+ without them!
Several different Heartless and Nobody types to fight
An item synthesis system with recipes that need to be deciphered
Sub-armor, equipment that can be synthesized to increase certain stats
And much more!

Version History:
-1.0.40-
Added Spiritualist Essence, the summon equivalent to the Warrior, Guardian, and Mystic essences, currently unobtainable but will be important later on
Added Stardust Fragment to Zenith Essence, to accomodate for the addition, it'll also use Spiritualist Essence when it becomes obtainable

-1.0.39-
Keybrand and Kingdom Key can only be used after Plantera is defeated
Kingdom Key requires 3 Zenithite to craft, rather than just 1
Zenithite is a lot less common from all sources
Zenithite now has a greatly reduced droprate from enemies when a boss is alive
Treasure Chests no longer spawn while a boss is alive

-1.0.38-
Optimized Munny and MP Orb pickup logic
Renamed Treasure Magnet to Munny Magnet to reduce confusion with the vanilla 1.4 item of the same name, this will mean that any existing Treasure Magnets will turn into unloaded items (thankfully they are fairly cheap to replace)
Slightly shrinked Strike Raid's hitbox, this shouldn't affect the overall effectiveness of the projectile
Changed the homepage to link to the github repository, in the readme you'll be able to find the discord invite link

-1.0.37-
Gave Strike Raid and Judgment afterimages and fixed up Eternal Flames' afterimages
Reduced the damage nerf for Judgment if being used with the normal Keybrand, since it made that kinda useless in general
Keybrand Mold no longer requires a shortsword
Added a secret method to obtain a certain item

-1.0.36-
Added the Hollow Sigil, a challenge item obtained on character creation, or by crafting it at a demon altar
Favoriting the Hollow Sigil will lock your maximum life to 1 point, this has a special interaction with the Crown Charm
Zenithite+ can now be found in Treasure Chests, having a 1/256 chance to replace any normal Zenithite that would drop

-1.0.35-
Judgement has reduced damage and crit rate when hitting the same target

-1.0.34-
Fixed Judgement targeting behaving strangely if its current target is behind a wall
Judgement should no longer get stuck on enemies that turn invincible (I.E. Moon Lord's eyes)

-1.0.33-
Due to the fact that it's entirely possible to have a dungeon without an Abyssal Tide, they are now always generated in chests containing a Muramasa
Zenithite+ is now actually obtainable, apparently I disabled them for some reason, probably because they were pretty useless
Added Aero-Carbon Alloy, Aerosteel Plating, and Aerogel, which all can be found in chests and can be used along with a single Zenithite+ to make the Zenitherium Crucible, though its use is currently purely aesthetic

-1.0.32-
Judgement now homes into enemies it hasn't hit recently instead of being controlled with the cursor
Judgement gives 1/3 of the usual delta granted from damage dealt, the same reduction applies to Draconic Flare's debris
Reduced Keybrand D/Kingdom Key D alt attack MP cost and removed the 1 projectile restriction
Kingdom Key D no longer requires 10 of all 3 mech boss souls, it can now be crafted using any combination of 2 mech boss' souls
Broken Hero Keybrand can be obtained from any Solar Eclipse enemy, though at a much lower rate than from Mothrons
Crown Charm no longer grants extended invincibility, but now has a much shorter cooldown
Crown Charm is more commonly dropped from Treasure Chests
Added a new element type, Light, used by the Keybrand and Kingdom Key
Resprited Circle of Life, Flame Liberator, Keybrand of Heart, and the tiered prehm keybrands, courtesy of Teesi
Some other miscellaneous changes that I forgor or don't feel like documenting

-1.0.31-
Some changes to Glide's tooltips to make its usage clearer

-1.0.30-
The Quick Ether key is more intelligent, using the appropriate tier of Ether as necessary, behavior during MP Charge is unchanged
Turbo-Ether can now be directly used to provide brief but potent MP regeneration outside of MP Charge, this effect can't be triggered by the Quick Ether key
The Keybrand Master now sells the Turbo-Ether at all times with a slightly marked up price
The Keybrand Master now sells Elixirs after Plantera is defeated instead of after Moon Lord is defeated, also with a higher price
Adjusted the price of some of the Keybrand Master's other wares
Changed some of the Keybrand Master's quotes
Changed the rarity color of the Crown Charm yet again, also made its tooltip slightly more concise with less clutter

-1.0.29-
Treasure Chests now have an extremely rare chance (0.5%) to drop the Crown Charm, for now this is the only way to obtain it

-1.0.28-
Fixed MP Prizes not dropping in multiplayer??
Increased the drop rate of Munny and lowered the price of the Uncharged Crystal

-1.0.27-
Hopefully fixed a syncing issue with Eternal Flames
Strike Raid should spend less time being useless when not in line of sight of its owner

-1.0.26-
Made the optional natural MP regen faster, though you're still better off using Ethers

-1.0.25-
Cure and its variants fills the owner player's Delta by the heal amount whenever it heals a player other than the owner
This stacks with each player, although it's reduced by 25%, multiplicative, for each additional player healed
The Delta bonus is reduced for each time the healing field pulses

-1.0.24-
Draconic Flare inflicts halved damage if detonated manually

-1.0.23-
Significantly reduced the knockback of a few keybrands' alt attacks, because apparently I forgot to do so, this is more of a buff than a nerf surprisingly

-1.0.22-
Hopefully fixed Treasure chests not giving anything when opened in multiplayer even though items visually drop for the client
Made keybrand crafting materials less rare from Treasure Chests, but conversely made Treasure Chests more rare

-1.0.21-
Slightly reduced the cost of some keybrands' physical alt attacks by about 25-33%
Flame Liberator's alt attack now properly consumes the displayed 4MP instead of improperly consuming 7MP on use
Nerfed Strike Raid's effectiveness against the Destroyer
The amount of MP restored when filling the Delta gauge now scales with max MP, this may be adjusted in upcoming updates

-1.0.20-
Keybrand Master now sells the Zenith Stim and Divinity Potion as intended

-1.0.19-
Crown Charm is now considered special Sub-Armor, this will be significant later on
Crown Charm also now provides 10% Nil resistance at the expense of 5% reduced damage with keybrands
There can now only be one Draconic Flare active, but firing another will cause the previous to detonate
In addition, Draconic Flare is considerably more expensive to cast
Mirage Asthral Erosion and Draconic Aura no longer causes target dummies to explode into Draconic Debris randomly
Added a very specific easter egg to the Treasure Chest
Some more things I decided to add last minute

-1.0.18-
Added a config option to hide the MP bar when you're not holding a keybrand, enabled by default
Also added a config option for very slow MP regen, disabled by default, mostly as a joke I admit
Crown Charm's cooldown now always lasts for 15 seconds, no matter what mode it is, it's also now once more an expert exclusive item, not that it matters right now since it's unobtainable
Buffed Chimera, maybe a little too much
Draconic Flare is better against crowds but kinda sucks against single targets, the damage output is worth it though
MP prizes have a new sound when picked up
Chests have a new sound when opened, they also now properly cannot be opened when enemies are nearby
A bunch more things I can't remember but probably aren't noticable on your end

-1.0.17-
Added a new element, Nil, which ignores all defense and resistances
Nil attacks are rare, but their damage can be devastating
Added Treasure Chests, an uncommon sight in the underground caves, hit them with a keybrand to get some loot, as long as there are no foes nearby
Also added a placeable Treasure Chest to go along with it, they are unique in the fact that they can only be opened when holding a keybrand
The Keybrand Master is a bit more serious this time around
This should hopefully be the last update on the road to 1.1.0, but as always let the devs know if things go wrong

-1.0.16-
Chimera's Bite has more initial velocity as it felt too difficult to aim at times
Chimera and Bleak Midnight have higher stats when Shadows of Abaddon is enabled to be on par with Asthraltite weaponry
Mirage Draconic Blaze (the debuff that Bleak Midnight's Draconic Flare inflicts) does more damage over time when Shadows of Abaddon is enabled
The buff for Bleak Midnight is temporary until a planned upgrade for it is implemented

-1.0.15-
Fixed some things, due to the changes to MP Haste
Added a Developer rarity which is similar to the Contributor rarity but with a cyan-ish blue (not the same as vanilla's cyan rarity), and renamed a lot of items accordingly
Renamed Fullbright Dye to Ultrabright Dye
Added a reference to something to the Keybrand Master

-1.0.14-
MP Haste and similar attatched abilities are now dynamic, increasing recharge rate instead of lowering the maximum charge time
The boosts are multiplicative, and the maximum recharge rate is hard-capped at 3x the normal speed
As a result, the 25% direct melee damage boost during MP Charge is only active when at or above 50% of the maximum MP Charge time

-1.0.13-
Fixed a visual bug involving the Delta gauge
A keybrand or lockblade other than the starting Wooden Keybrand is now required for the Keybrand Master to move in
The Keybrand Master has upgraded his armor and now he's pretty much invincible to all forms of damage

-1.0.12-
Doing damage with Keybrands now fill a Delta bar located just below the MP gauge, which will restore a small amount of MP when full, similar to a mechanic present in the first Kingdom Hearts
During MP Charge, when the Delta gauge is filled, it will reduce charge time by 1 second
Direct melee hits will fill more delta than ranged and magic attacks
During MP charge, if the maximum recharge time is longer than 10 seconds, and the current recharge time is over half the maximum, direct melee hits will inflict 25% more damage
Fixed charged crystals not restoring MP when at previous full MP (poor wording I know)

-1.0.11-
Added a set of crystals that will increase your max MP when consumed, they are crafted using uncharged crystals bought from the Keybrand Master as well as various materials
The recipes for these crystals are subject to change and will require key ingredients from certain bosses added by Keybrands+
Fixed Fullbright shader breaking servers

-1.0.10-
Improved visuals for Cure
Cure boost is its own stat and is used for increasing/decreasing efficiency of cure instead of magic Keybrand damage boosts
Added Cure, Cura, and Curaga spellbooks, these are less efficient than the Cure spells attached to keybrands, but can be helpful in a pinch
Buffed Chimera
Buffed Bleak Midnight, tier shifted to post-ML
Max MP is now saved with the player, methods of increasing max MP in normal gameplay are yet to be added

-1.0.9-
Improved dust visuals for Zenithite, Zenithite+, and Draconic Flare

-1.0.8-
Keybrands only make enemies drop hearts on death, it's also no longer guaranteed

-1.0.7-
Added Quick Ether hotkey (bound to F by default)

-1.0.6-
Fixed alignment not updating correctly

-1.0.5-
Enemies will always drop at least 1 MP prize if it fails to roll the higher drop amounts
Fixed Flame Liberator's glowmask being visible when it shouldn't (right click attack)

-1.0.4-
MP Charge now only lasts for 20 seconds when depleted, down from 30
Added some proper glowmasks
Added a new dye, mostly to get away with not adding a glowmask for wings

-1.0.3-
Your current/max MP is now visible when your cursor is over the bar
You now start with 10 Ethers
MP is now fully restored on death
Munny is no longer attracted by Treasure Magnet and its upgrades if it was dropped by a player

-1.0.2-
Added credits

-1.0.1-
Github integration, icon is now visible on the browser

-1.0.0- "Awakening"
Initial Release
