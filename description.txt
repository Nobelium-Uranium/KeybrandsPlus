A far-off memory that's like a scattered dream...
I want to line the pieces up... yours, and mine.

THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE, DO NOT DISTRIBUTE! 

Keybrands+ Re:coded is, as the name would suggest, a full rewrite of my old Keybrands+ I made a very long time ago.

Currently, this mod adds:
13 unique keybrands with alternate attack modes and attached abilities, plus a rework of the original Keybrand
12 crafting materials, used to make and upgrade keybrands, among other things
1 friendly NPC, the Keybrand Master
A new currency, Munny, used to purchase various goods from the Keybrand Master
2 consumables, an Elixir that fully heals and a Panacea that cures all debuffs
2 accessories, the Crown Charm (currently unobtainable) and the Aero Glider

Planned features:
Even more keybrands, including the elusive Ultima Weapon!
Heartless and Nobodies will make their debut eventually!
