I want to line the pieces up... yours, and mine.

Keybrands+ Re:coded is, as the name suggests, a full rewrite of the original Keybrands+ mod that I made a very long time ago.
It aims to add many keybrands with some being stronger or more versatile than others and also to expand the concepts of multi-class weaponry and equipment.
Gather keybrands throughout the game to combat the Heartless threat and become the one true keybrand master!

Currently, this mod adds:
Many, many keybrands, most providing alternate attack modes and attached abilities, plus a rework of the original Keybrand
A new town NPC, the Keybrand Master who sells restorative potions and useful materials
A new currency, Munny, used to purchase various goods
Several crafting materials, used to make and upgrade keybrands, among other things
Several consumables, including a salty yet sweet treat, and a panacea to cure all that ails you
Several accessories, including the Crown Charm which will grant you a second chance, and multiple tiers of enhanced gliding
This mod also introduces a new resource used by keybrands, MP, which does not regenerate naturally but can be restored through several methods and will recharge when depleted

Planned features:
Many more keybrands! It wouldn't be Keybrands+ without them!
Several different Heartless and Nobody types to fight
An item synthesis system with recipes that need to be deciphered
Sub-armor, equipment that can be synthesized to increase certain stats
And much more!

Version History:
-1.0.18-
Added a config option to hide the MP bar when you're not holding a keybrand, enabled by default
Also added a config option for very slow MP regen, disabled by default, mostly as a joke I admit
Crown Charm's cooldown now always lasts for 15 seconds, no matter what mode it is, it's also now once more an expert exclusive item, not that it matters right now since it's unobtainable
Buffed Chimera, maybe a little too much
Draconic Flare is better against crowds but kinda sucks against single targets, the damage output is worth it though
MP prizes have a new sound when picked up
Chests have a new sound when opened, they also now properly cannot be opened when enemies are nearby
A bunch more things I can't remember but probably aren't noticable on your end
Not quite 1.1.0, but I just wanted to add a few more things until then

-1.0.17-
Added a new element, Nil, which ignores all defense and resistances
Nil attacks are rare, but their damage can be devastating
Added Treasure Chests, an uncommon sight in the underground caves, hit them with a keybrand to get some loot, as long as there are no foes nearby
Also added a placeable Treasure Chest to go along with it, they are unique in the fact that they can only be opened when holding a keybrand
The Keybrand Master is a bit more serious this time around
This should hopefully be the last update on the road to 1.1.0, but as always let the devs know if things go wrong

-1.0.16-
Chimera's Bite has more initial velocity as it felt too difficult to aim at times
Chimera and Bleak Midnight have higher stats when Shadows of Abaddon is enabled to be on par with Asthraltite weaponry
Mirage Draconic Blaze (the debuff that Bleak Midnight's Draconic Flare inflicts) does more damage over time when Shadows of Abaddon is enabled
The buff for Bleak Midnight is temporary until a planned upgrade for it is implemented

-1.0.15-
Fixed some things, due to the changes to MP Haste
Added a Developer rarity which is similar to the Contributor rarity but with a cyan-ish blue (not the same as vanilla's cyan rarity), and renamed a lot of items accordingly
Renamed Fullbright Dye to Ultrabright Dye
Added a reference to something to the Keybrand Master

-1.0.14-
MP Haste and similar attatched abilities are now dynamic, increasing recharge rate instead of lowering the maximum charge time
The boosts are multiplicative, and the maximum recharge rate is hard-capped at 3x the normal speed
As a result, the 25% direct melee damage boost during MP Charge is only active when at or above 50% of the maximum MP Charge time

-1.0.13-
Fixed a visual bug involving the Delta gauge
A keybrand or lockblade other than the starting Wooden Keybrand is now required for the Keybrand Master to move in
The Keybrand Master has upgraded his armor and now he's pretty much invincible to all forms of damage

-1.0.12-
Doing damage with Keybrands now fill a Delta bar located just below the MP gauge, which will restore a small amount of MP when full, similar to a mechanic present in the first Kingdom Hearts
During MP Charge, when the Delta gauge is filled, it will reduce charge time by 1 second
Direct melee hits will fill more delta than ranged and magic attacks
During MP charge, if the maximum recharge time is longer than 10 seconds, and the current recharge time is over half the maximum, direct melee hits will inflict 25% more damage
Fixed charged crystals not restoring MP when at previous full MP (poor wording I know)

-1.0.11-
Added a set of crystals that will increase your max MP when consumed, they are crafted using uncharged crystals bought from the Keybrand Master as well as various materials
The recipes for these crystals are subject to change and will require key ingredients from certain bosses added by Keybrands+
Fixed Fullbright shader breaking servers

-1.0.10-
Improved visuals for Cure
Cure boost is its own stat and is used for increasing/decreasing efficiency of cure instead of magic Keybrand damage boosts
Added Cure, Cura, and Curaga spellbooks, these are less efficient than the Cure spells attached to keybrands, but can be helpful in a pinch
Buffed Chimera
Buffed Bleak Midnight, tier shifted to post-ML
Max MP is now saved with the player, methods of increasing max MP in normal gameplay are yet to be added

-1.0.9-
Improved dust visuals for Zenithite, Zenithite+, and Draconic Flare

-1.0.8-
Keybrands only make enemies drop hearts on death, it's also no longer guaranteed

-1.0.7-
Added Quick Ether hotkey (bound to F by default)

-1.0.6-
Fixed alignment not updating correctly

-1.0.5-
Enemies will always drop at least 1 MP prize if it fails to roll the higher drop amounts
Fixed Flame Liberator's glowmask being visible when it shouldn't (right click attack)

-1.0.4-
MP Charge now only lasts for 20 seconds when depleted, down from 30
Added some proper glowmasks
Added a new dye, mostly to get away with not adding a glowmask for wings

-1.0.3-
Your current/max MP is now visible when your cursor is over the bar
You now start with 10 Ethers
MP is now fully restored on death
Munny is no longer attracted by Treasure Magnet and its upgrades if it was dropped by a player

-1.0.2-
Added credits

-1.0.1-
Github integration, icon is now visible on the browser

-1.0.0- "Awakening"
Initial Release
